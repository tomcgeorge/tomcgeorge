# 👋 Hi, I'm Tom George

**Cloud & Infrastructure Lead | AWS | Azure | DevOps Engineer**

I architect scalable cloud infrastructure and lead DevOps transformations, primarily on AWS and Azure. I build end-to-end solutions from infrastructure to applications, focusing on automation, reliability, and measurable business impact.

## 🎯 What I Do

**Cloud & Infrastructure:**
- Design and implement multi-account AWS platforms using Control Tower and Well-Architected principles
- Build production CI/CD pipelines with integrated security scanning that reduce deployment time by 50%
- Establish SLO-driven observability frameworks that improve incident response by 40%
- Lead infrastructure migrations with proven cost savings (20%+) and reliability improvements

**Application Development:**
- Build serverless applications using AWS Amplify, AppSync, Lambda, and DynamoDB
- Develop React/TypeScript frontends integrated with AWS services
- Create Node.js backends with GraphQL APIs and REST endpoints
- Implement data transformation workflows for operational analytics

## 💼 Real Impact (Not Buzzwords)

- **99.9% uptime** maintained during SaaS platform transformation
- **50% faster deployments** through automated CI/CD with Snyk security gates
- **40% MTTR reduction** via proactive monitoring (New Relic + CloudWatch)
- **20% infrastructure cost savings** through AWS rightsizing and optimization
- **Serverless web application** supporting multi-tenant architecture with Amplify + AppSync
- **Reduced manual operations by 30%** through automation and process improvement

**Databases:** SQL Server (primary), RDS (PostgreSQL/MySQL), DynamoDB  
**Data:** SQL analytics, ETL workflows, operational data transformation

## 🌱 Currently Learning

I believe in continuous learning and staying current with industry trends:

- **Data Orchestration:** Building ELT pipelines with Kestra and PostgreSQL for modern data workflows
- **AI/ML Integration:** Exploring LLM frameworks and AI-driven automation for DevOps workflows
- **Kubernetes in Production:** Moving beyond ECS/EKS basics to advanced K8s patterns, Helm, and operators
- **Terraform:** Transitioning from CloudFormation to multi-cloud IaC with modules and workspaces
- **Azure Expansion:** Deepening Azure services knowledge for multi-cloud strategies

## 💡 My Approach

I focus on **measurable impact** over vanity metrics. I believe in **honest skill representation**; if I list something, I can build it and explain the trade-offs. I prefer automation that solves real problems over automation for its own sake.

I've learned that the best solutions balance technical excellence with business pragmatism. Not every problem needs the latest technology; sometimes the right answer is the boring, reliable one.
